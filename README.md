# Pythonic Compiler

A Simple compiler to parse python files and build and analyse Python AST.

## Requirements

### Numba Version
This project requires **Numba 0.60.0**. Please ensure you have this specific version installed to avoid compatibility issues.

### Python Interpreter Version
The project is built based on **Python 3.10**, specifically **Python 3.10.12**. Based on my tests, using lower versions of Python leads to discrepancies in the Control Flow Graph (CFG) structure generated by Numba. Additionally, SSA transformation may fail when using different versions of the Python interpreter.

### Important Note
To ensure consistent behavior, it is necessary to use **Python 3.10.12** with Numba 0.60.0. Deviating from these versions may result in unexpected behavior or errors during code execution.
